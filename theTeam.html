        		            Hello! I am a senior in
                          Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines.I am
                          often keeping myself busy with my studies, playing whatever
                          video game piques my interest, or listening to music. I enjoy
                          spending time with my friends and the memories that come with
                          it. I enjoy Mines for the sense of community I've gotten, as
                          well as the challenging, but highly enjoyable classes. I look
                          forward to contributing to PATHS and the field of Computer
                          Science this upcoming year!

        		            I am currently majoring in
                          computer science and putting an emphasis on cyber
                          security. Outside of computer science I try to live a rich
                          life in the mountains. When I’m not pounding away at my
                          keyboard, I’m climbing or backpacking. I continuously strive
                          to find the work life balance without sacrificing too much of
                          either. As Mines students we can all relate to the difficulty
                          of this task.

        		            I am a freshman at Mines this
                          year. I am a Colorado native and graduated from D'Evelyn High
                          School. I am so excited to be majoring in computer science at
                          Mines. I've always wanted to help get more students interested
                          in computer science and the PATHS program will allow me to do
                          just that.

            		      I am a junior in
                          Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines. I was born in
                          Chile and moved to Lakewood, Colorado, when I was 9
                          years-old. In my free time I enjoy experimenting with all
                          sorts of art mediums, from drawing to photography to face
                          painting, as well as video games, soccer, archery, and
                          more. Despite having a variety of different interests I
                          decided to study Computer Science because of how applicable
                          the field is. I wish to apply technology in areas which lack
                          or could benefit from it, for instance, mental health. I want
                          to not only watch as innovative solutions are developed but
                          hopefully create those developments myself while encouraging
                          others to do the same.

                          served as an excellent opportunity for me to not only explore
                          my interest in computer science with classmates and friends
                          sharing similar passions but also to think critically about
                          how I'd like to impact the world. It hasn't been easy but
                          Mines provides the resources to help me tackle issues I'm
                          passionate about addressing. Two issues I'd like to address
                          include America's suicide epidemic and outdated approach to
                          learning.

        		            Hi! I am a freshman at
                  Mines. I was born and raised in Colorado, and have lived
                  pretty much everywhere on the east side of the mountains. I
                  enjoy traveling, reading, painting, and much more! I have a
                  passion for technology, and am very thankful for my chance to
                  study Computer Science and be a part of PATHS.

        		            Hi! I recently
                  transferred to School of Mines from Red Rocks Community
                  College Spring of 2019. I am a Colorado native and grew up not
                  more than 15 minutes from Mines. During whatever free time I
                  may have I enjoy working on robotics projects or
                  long-boarding, if the weather is cooperative. Last year I
                  founded a company to produce educational electronics kits to
                  students for cheap while still maintaining a high level of
                  functionality. I hope to graduate and really pursue growing my
                  company. I decided on CS, because I believe it allows me the
                  best opportunity to develop skill sets that I may use to
                  impact the lives of many. I chose Mines because it has an
                  amazing Computer Science department and the community in the
                  department is incredibly supportive.

        		            I am a sophomore at
                  Colorado School of Mines planning on majoring in Computer
                  Science, with a potential minor in biomechanical or
                  biomedical. I was born and raised in Colorado and have loved
                  everything about it. I decided to come to Mines because
                  pursuing a career in the STEM field feels incredibly
                  empowering, and, in doing so, I hope to inspire my sisters and
                  others – showing that, even if there are obstacles in the STEM
                  field, those can be overcome with passion and determination. I
                  hope that through computer science I will be able to help
                  others and give back to my community.

                  year at Mines, especially within the computer science
                  department. Everyone is such diligent workers, that I am
                  inspired everyday to push myself more and more. I cannot wait
                  to take more computer science classes and figure out what
                  focus I want. I also am involved with Greek life on campus; I
                  am in Alpha Phi. I am the Director of Social Media for my
                  chapter, and I am also the Intramural and Club Sports
                  Marketing Executive! I love to keep busy and cannot wait to

        		            I am a freshman

                eldest of 5 other siblings. When I am not wasting my life away
                reading too many sci-fi books, you can find me absorbed in
                my laptop learning new(and sometimes useless) things. I have
                always enjoyed sharing my love for learning with others, be it
                my siblings, other students, or parents so being able to
                continue this as part of the PATHS program is something that I
                really look forward to.

                thing that I hope to gain is the knowledge and experience that
                I will have here. I love anything that has to do with sports
                and I am very active. I hope to enjoy all there is to have at

              I am getting more involved on campus including the Acts of Random
              Kindness club and resident advising. So far I have had a great time here at the
              Colorado School of Mines and plan to continue to have a great
              time. If I am not around to be seen I am probably either studying
              or playing some video game in my room with my close friends and
              family. Through PATHS, I look forward to introducing future
              students to the vibrant CS@Mines community

        		           Hello! I am a transfer student from Front Range
        		           Community College starting at Mines in Fall of 2019. I am an Applied and Computational 
        		           Mathematics major with plans of minoring in Computer Science. As a Colorado native, I have 
        		           wanted to attend the School of Mines for as long as I can remember, and could not be more excited 
        		           to be part of such a reputable school and program such as PATHS. I look forward to inspiring, motivating, 
        		           and mentoring others with Computer Science; a field that I believe can be as fulfilling as it is challenging.

        		            I will be going into my
                  sophomore year as a computer science student here at Mines. I
                  come from the rural parts of Aguascalientes, Mexico, but grew
                  up in Denver up to the present day. Ever since I was little, I
                  have grown a passion for soccer, and it is a sport I cannot
                  live without. I came to realize my
                  favorite application for numbers, logic, and math was computer
                  science thus current field of study. I was raised and taught
                  by my parents to always work my guts out because it would pay
                  off eventually. I look forward to another year with
                  this amazing program!

        		            I'm a freshman going into
                  Computer Science at Mines. I grew up in Denver and graduated
                  from Thomas Jefferson High School. I like to geek out over
                  video games, physics, math, and various other things. I'm
                  super excited to be able to learn about the field and
                  contribute to the community at Mines!

        		            As an
                  incoming freshman, I believe that PATHS is not only a verbal
                  definition for a certain program but rather a community and
                  inherent guideline for learning the whims and ways of
                  technology. If I were to define PATHS under a single word, I
                  would express it as "inspiration." Without having yet stepped
                  foot into the shoes of a PATHS member, I still can sense the
                  program's welcoming and very motivated Computer Science and
                  Community Outreach prospect. My name is Jordan T, and I really
                  look forward to meeting with all to share the memories that
                  will come. Thanks!

        		            I am a Comp Sci sophomore. I was
                  born in England but have lived here in Colorado since
                  elementary school. I came to computer science originally to
                  make video games, but now I plan to use those skills to make
                  our world a better place in the future. For the past three
                  years, I have been participating in a summer internship at the
                  Space arm of Lockheed Martin, helping to develop Virtual
                  Reality experiences. In my free time, I like to work on
                  programming side-projects, play games, and learn foreign
                  languages. With PATHS, I aim to help my fellow students reach
                  their full potential and to join me in saving the world.

        		            Hey, my name is Kyle Moran and I’m a sophomore majoring in
              Computer Science at CSM. I’m a Colorado born native and couldn't
              bear to leave. I love hiking, camping and ultimate frisbee. I run
              Cross Country and Track and Field and love the team.I’ve always liked computers and fell in love with programming
              after taking a class in high school. I came to Mines because of
              their great STEM programs and have no regrets. I’m excited to
              help the next generation of PATHS Scholars and bolster the future
              Mines Computer Science program.

        		           I’m a freshman CS
                major. I’ve always been really into Computers, video games, and
                just tech in general.  A few years back I decided to teach
                myself how to program. I say that I taught myself programming
                very loosely as most of my learning came from the wonderful
                teachers and mentors I had around to help guide me through some
                tough spots. It’s this very environment that drew me towards
                both Mines and the PATHS program in the first place. Outside of
                school I love to spend time with my 6 younger siblings and
                improve my overall strength through powerlifting and BJJ. I’m
                really excited to get involved with CS@Mines and get to know all
                of my peers!

        		            PATHS; a program that encapsulates this spirit of
                discovery, of companionship, leadership, and ultimately, helping
                each other move forward on our journeys. By the end, we'll have
                learned about each other, about our passions, and about this
                magnificent world of magic that we call technology. I've already
                set foot on my own path, witnessing the beyond through aerospace
                design, imagining the impossible through game development, and
                rendering my thoughts through artistic expression. My name is
                Nicholas Woodward, and I am glad to have found some other

        		            I'm a Computer Science
                  Master's student at Mines scheduled to graduate in December
                  2019. I also received a CS Bachelor's degree last December
                  2018 from Mines. Before Mines, I went to Red Rocks community
                  college where I completed my Associates Of Science with an
                  emphasis in Cyber Security. While at Mines, I had the chance
                  to meet great individuals with whom I was able to learn and
                  grow alongside. Within PATH'S I connected with awesome new
                  comrades, had the opportunity to be a role model as well as
                  participate in really fun activities. Through it all, Mines
                  has become one of my favorite places. I plan to continue on
                  with a Ph.D. degree here at Mines.

        		         I am a freshman at
                  Colorado School of Mines. I was born in California and raised
                  in Colorado. Most of my time is spent running, taking photos,
                  and being with family and friends. I have always been
                  fascinated by the functioning mechanisms of the world, so
                  naturally STEM was my calling. Ever since I took my first
                  programming class in high school, I knew I wanted to pursued
                  an education in Computer Science. Seeing my products come to
                  life with a few lines of writing was captivating! As a PATHS
                  scholar, I hope to inspire and help others learn about the
                  world of Computer Science. I am excited to continue my
                  passions in coding and track here at Mines. I can not wait to
                  be apart of the PATHS program!

        		            I am a second-year
                  here at Mines studying Computer Science. I'm from a small
                  rural town called Lamar here in Colorado which is very
                  different from living near the mountains in Golden. My first
                  year at Mines has been an awesome experience and was
                  everything I expected and more. There are so many
                  opportunities to get involved, especially in the CS
                  department, and it has been so welcoming from the start. For
                  this upcoming year, I'll be a U-CLIMB mentor which will be a
                  great way to immerse myself even more in Computer Science and
                  be able to help those first entering the CS field! I am really
                  looking forward to another year here at Mines!

        		            I ballroom dance and brew my own kombucha recreationally. I love to learn new languages—inside and outside 
        		            of programming—and I look forward to snowboarding every winter. I want to bring about some positive change in the world. 
        		            I am immensely grateful to have become a part of the PATHS program, and am excited to see where it can take us!
