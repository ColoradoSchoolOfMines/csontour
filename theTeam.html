				<p>Jordan Card: CS Graduate Student, Program Coordinator</p>
				<p>I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Security. I have my Bachelor's degree in mathematics with a minor in physics. I've been teaching/tutoring on and off for 5 years about different STEM topics. Outside of academics, I was a collegiate water polo player and still play recreationally. Also, I enjoy reading if time allows.</p>

				<p>Morgan Cox: CS Undergraduate Student</p>
				<p>I am currently a sophomore studying computer science with a minor in economics. I enjoy computer science and I believe that it has great potential across many fields in science and technology. I believe that computer science is important for more people to understand since it affects our everyday lives in many ways. I plan on entering the business world after I graduate from Mines. I am studying computer science because I believe that it will be a very useful tool and I find it extremely fascinating.</p>

				<p>Jordan Newport: CS Undergraduate Student</p>
				<p> I am an Undergraduate at Mines. After graduating, I intend to pursue graduate school. I tend to prefer working behind-the-scenes and at lower levels, rather than on the user interface side of a project. Recently, I've worked on the CSM Assocation for Computing Machinery Club website, and I'm involved in a research project using a network of Ardunio computers with moisture sensors to implements a smart irrigation system. When I'm not programming or studying, I enjoy playing board games, rock climbing, and playing racquetball.<p>

				<p>Jesus Nunez: CS Undergraduate Student</p>
				<p>I am a freshman at Mines. I am from a Hispanic family, where Spanish is my second language. I chose to major in CS because of my love for computers. As a child, I loved to take apart my old computers and figure out how to put it back together. I plan to major in Computer Science with a desire to either create software for scientific use such as astronomy or for video games. </p>

				<p>Hi! My name is Demonna and I am currently a senior studying Computer Science at Mines. Besides from being a student, I am currently an intern at Northrop Grumman. On the side, I enjoy watching romantic comedies and kickboxing. My favorite thing about CS is the ability to creativity create mobile applications, artifical intelligence, robotics, and anything else you can think of! It is truly an open field that allows you to specialize in anything you want!<p>
